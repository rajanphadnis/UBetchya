# U-Betchya!
Simple Android-based betting app.

# Description
This app is designed to be simple for everyone to use. Imagine you are at a bar, and you say to your friend "I bet $20 that the Chargers will win". Your friend accepts that bet. You both open up the app, one of you selects the dollar amount, and chooses the person from a list of nearby devices. The other person accepts the bet on the app. When the game is over, the app will automatically transfer money if necessary, depending on who won the bet. Users do not need to be near each other when the bet is over.
